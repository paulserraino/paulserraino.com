Last night I attended [Austin JS](https://twitter.com/AustinJS), it's a monthly javascript meetup located in Austin Texas. It was a lot fun. The main speaker built a speech recognition game named [who said it best](http://whosaiditbest.website) and invited folks to partake, it was definitely the highlight of the meetup. I also meet a lot of chill devs and there was free pizza and beer. I highly recommend going to meetups. Building a strong network is the key to success in any career and itâ€™s also a great way to gain new perspectives on building software.
