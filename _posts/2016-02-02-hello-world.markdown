summary: I'm revamping my blog!
---

So a lot is happening in 2016: I quit my job, I started a company ([Tiny Satellites](http://www.tinysatellites.com)) and i'm revamping my blog, with hopes that someone out there will find what I have to say useful (or at least mildly entertaining). I plan on writing a ton on business and web development, so sit tight.
