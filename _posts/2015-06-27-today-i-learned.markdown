I've been working at a startup in Austin, Tx for about six months. So far, I can confidently say I've learn a ton and I'm still learning a lot on a daily basis.

A few weeks ago, a coworker and I had a conversation about possibly starting an engineering blog, to document what we've learned. I thought it was a great idea, which is why I've decided to start blogging again. I want to share my progress as a developer with everyone, how ever trivial each topic might seem. It's easy to solve a problem then move on to the next issue, without any intention to document or share one's experience with the world. TIL, everyone should blog more.
