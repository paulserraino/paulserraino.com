This week I finally made the decision that enough is enough, i'm learning [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). It's actually a pretty interesting library. It's great for managing lots of [state](http://ricostacruz.com/cheatsheets/react.html#states--properties). It's easy to write extensionable components, with [mixins](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html). It's easy to [test](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react.html) (also see [here](https://github.com/paulserraino/react-with-tests-starter)). Alright, I get it now, React you win.
